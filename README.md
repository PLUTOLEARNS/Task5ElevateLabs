# Task 05: Wireshark Network Traffic Capture & Analysis

This task involved using **Wireshark** to capture, observe, and analyze live network traffic, helping develop a fundamental understanding of network protocols and packet behavior.

## Objectives

- Install and configure Wireshark for packet capture.
- Generate various types of network traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP, DNS).
- Capture packets in real time and apply protocol-specific filters.
- Analyze protocol behavior (e.g., TCP handshakes, DNS lookups).
- Explore layered protocol stacks within individual packets.
- Export and document the capture session.

## Key Activities

- Visited websites and used ping/nslookup commands to generate traffic.
- Applied filters (`http`, `dns`, `icmp`, `tcp`, `tls`) to isolate and study specific protocols.
- Examined individual packet details including headers and payloads.
- Summarized protocol layers from Ethernet to Application layer.
- Used Wiresharkâ€™s statistics features to understand traffic flow and hierarchy.

## Outcomes

- Gained insights into encrypted vs. unencrypted traffic.
- Understood how everyday internet activity translates to network protocols.
- Documented the capture and saved it in `.pcap` format for review.
